# ELPSE

The "Eikonal Laser-Plasma Simulation Environment" is a series of Matlab functions that can be used to invesigate the properties of intense electromagnetic waves propagating in plasmas. Unlike the wave-based code [LPSE](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999119306217) (which inspired the name) it uses "ray tracing" or "geometrical optics" techniques and associated techniques used to address problems encountered by ray tracing, such as the formation of caustics, mode conversion, resonance, and parametric resonance.

It is intended to be used by researchers in the field of inertial confinement fusion.

## Getting Started

Currently the code consits of a series of Matlab scripts and functions. Executing some of the scripts found in ./Scripts will give you the general idea.

### Prerequisites

Currently, a reasonably recent version of Matlab should suffice.
